The image above shows all the prerequisites downloaded to begin our installation of osTicket.  The steps I took to get to this result are the following:
  
 - A virtual machine created in Azure with 2-4 Virtual CPUs
 - Install | Enable IIS in Windows with CGI and Common HTTP features
 - Install PHP manager for IIS, Rewrite Module, PHP 7.3.8, VC_redist.x86.exe, and MySQL 5.5.62
 - Created a directory for PHP on the c drive

In this step, I registered PHP from within IIS. The steps taken are the following:

  - Open IIS as an administrator (type in start menu IIS and right-click to run as administrator)
  - Click on PHP manager
  - Register new PHP version: Browse and go to the c drive to register with PHP we created in our first few steps
  - Reload IIS ( you can choose to end and start the server or you can choose to restart it)
